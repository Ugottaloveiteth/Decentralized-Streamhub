Features

    Tokenized Rewards: Content creators and users are rewarded with native ERC-20 tokens for engagement.
    NFT Minting: Content can be minted as NFTs (ERC-721/1155) and traded on secondary marketplaces.
    Decentralized Livestreaming: Integrated with Livepeer for decentralized video streaming.
    Integration with Social Platforms: Seamlessly connects with Desofy, Farcaster, ICP, Twitter, and future integrations like TikTok, Reddit, and Twitch.
    Decentralized Storage: Leverages IPFS and Arweave for decentralized content storage.
    Web3 Authentication: Users can connect their wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect) to interact with the platform.
    Governance and Community: Decentralized governance through token holders, allowing users to participate in platform decisions.

Technologies Used

    Blockchain & Smart Contracts:
        Ethereum / Polygon (for smart contracts)
        ERC-20, ERC-721/1155 Standards
        Hardhat (for contract deployment and testing)

    Frontend:
        React.js / Next.js (for the UI)
        Web3.js / Ethers.js (for Web3 interactions)

    Backend:
        Node.js with Express.js
        MongoDB (for user and content metadata storage)
        IPFS and Arweave (for decentralized content storage)
        Livepeer (for decentralized video streaming)

    APIs & Integrations:
        Twitter API
        Farcaster API
        Desofy API
        ICP (Internet Computer Protocol)

Architecture

The architecture is fully decentralized, leveraging blockchain technologies for content ownership, decentralized storage for content hosting, and Web 3.0 principles for user interaction.

    Frontend (React.js or Next.js) for user interaction and wallet connection.
    Backend (Node.js/Express) for handling API requests, user authentication, and interactions with smart contracts.
    Smart Contracts (ERC-20 for token rewards, ERC-721/1155 for NFTs) deployed on Ethereum or Polygon.
    Decentralized Storage using IPFS and Arweave for content files.
    Decentralized Livestreaming using Livepeer.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Node.js (v14 or higher)
    npm or yarn
    MetaMask (for Web3 integration)
    MongoDB (for backend database)
    Infura or Alchemy (for Ethereum API)

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Decentralized-StreamHub.git
cd Decentralized-StreamHub

Install dependencies:

    Frontend:

    bash

cd client
npm install

Backend:

bash

    cd ../server
    npm install

Set up environment variables:

    Create an .env file in the server/ directory:

    bash

        MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/streamhub
